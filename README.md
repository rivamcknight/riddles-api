## Background
This project was created with Node.js with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. I created this simple API to experiment with API documentation tools.

I am using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host a live working version of the app so that the interactive tools can actually be used.

For this project, I've chosen to document the API with three different tools: [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/), and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). I created a yaml file that follows the [OpenAPI Specification Version 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md) and used both Swagger UI and Stoplight to render the documentation. I also created the documentation using Markdown, which is the bulk of this readme. Select the links below to check out the results of each.

## Overview
This API allows you to get riddles and their answers, in various categories. The current categories of riddles include easy, hard, kids, math, word, and funny. In addition to requesting riddles in bulk, the endpoints allow you to request one random riddle from the entire database or one random riddle from a specific category. Seed data for the original riddle database is from [https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/](https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/). New riddles can be added and updated via the API.

**Riddles API Server**:  https://guarded-eyrie-88809.herokuapp.com

## Authentication
No authentication is needed to use this API.
