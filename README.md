## Background
This project was created with Node.js with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. I created this simple API to experiment with API documentation tools.

I am using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host a live version of the app so that the interactive tools are usable.

For this project, I've chosen to document the API with three different tools: [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/), and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). I created a yaml file that follows the [OpenAPI Specification Version 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md) and used both Swagger UI and Stoplight to render the documentation. I also created the documentation using Markdown, which is the bulk of this readme. Select the links below to check out the results of each.

## Overview
The Riddles API can return riddles from a variety of categories. Current categories include easy, hard, kids, math, word, and funny. Request one random riddle or request them all. Seed data for the original riddle database is from [https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/](https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/). New riddles can be added and updated via the API."

**Riddles API Server**:  https://guarded-eyrie-88809.herokuapp.com

No authentication is needed to use this API.

### Endpoints for getting riddles in bulk or by id

#### ðŸ“Œ To get all riddles or an individual riddle

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | /riddles | Returns Riddle objects |

Use the optional `id` query parameter to have the corresponding Riddle object returned. Omit the query parameter to have an array of all the Riddle objects in the database returned.

The optional query parameter is defined as:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | Optional | If the database id for a riddle is known, use this parameter to get that specific Riddle object. **Omit for all riddles to be returned.** |

Example curl request to get all riddles:
```
curl -X GET 'https://guarded-eyrie-88809.herokuapp.com/riddles'
```

The response will be an array of Riddle objects.

Example successful response of an array of riddles:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

[
  {
    "_id": "60bc3ffb5dcf8ac52f16a7fd",
    "riddle": "What has to be broken before you can use it?",
    "answer": "An egg",
    "category": "easy",
    "source": "https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/"

    "answer": "A candle",
    "category": "easy",
    "source": "https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/"
  }
]
```

The same endpoint can be used with the `id` query parameter to get an individual riddle. 

Example curl request to get an individual riddle:
```
curl -X GET 'https://guarded-eyrie-88809.herokuapp.com/riddles?id=60bd0708d7dcc31bd9376abe'
```

The response will be an individual Riddle object.

Example successful response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "_id": "60bd0708d7dcc31bd9376abe",
  "riddle": "I'm tall when I'm young, and I'm short when I'm old. What am I?",
  "answer": "A candle",
  "category": "easy",
  "source": "https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/"

| 404 | `Not Found`: This error will occur if the requested riddle `id` is not found in the database. It could also occur if the database is empty. |
| 500 | `Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server. |
